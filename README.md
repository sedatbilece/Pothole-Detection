# Pothole Detection with YOLO

We aimed to train a model in this project that detects potholes on the roads with approximately 2k data. The model takes 2-3 images per second from the video source, scans them, and takes them into the square for pothole detection. Thus, it can be integrated into real-time systems without requiring high performance.

## Our Weights

an class name called "cukur" and trained with 95.4888 image . Avg Loss 0.87 so its good like that model .


## Our Datasets
a mixed dataset was created in them
